## Release Retreats

These intimate retreats offer a gentle space for emotional release, reflection, and reconnection. Through guided stillness, breath, yoga, silence, and simple rituals, women are invited to meet what is present with compassion and care. There is no need to fix or explain — each retreat is an invitation to slow down, soften, and allow what is ready to move to unfold in its own time. ****

## Private Birth Preparation Workshops 

Rooted in my work as a certified birth doula, these workshops support women and couples in preparing for birth with trust, awareness, and embodied understanding. We explore the physiology of birth alongside breath, movement, and emotional preparation, creating space to build confidence, feel informed, and connect deeply with your own intuition and inner resources. Soon I will be offering group workshops also.

## Pre/Postnatal Yoga

These yoga sessions support women through pregnancy and the postpartum period with gentleness, care, and informed guidance. Drawing on my work as a birth doula, classes are shaped by an understanding of birth physiology and optimal positioning for babies, supporting both maternal comfort and pelvic balance. Practices focus on breath, body awareness, strength, and rest, while honouring the physical and emotional transitions of this time, offering a safe and nurturing space to reconnect with your body and intuition.

## Vinyasa Yoga

Vinyasa classes are fluid, grounding, and breath-led, inviting you to move with presence and curiosity. With an emphasis on embodied awareness, these practices support strength, mobility, and inner steadiness, offering space to reconnect with the body and find moments of calm within movement.
